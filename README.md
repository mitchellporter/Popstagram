Popstagram
==========
Popstagram is a fun little iOS app I made that takes some of the clutter out of using the official Instagram app. Popstagram allows you to easily view the most popular Instagram photos at the moment, or to search for photos by hashtag.

I hope you enjoy using this app as much as I enjoyed making it.

Popstagram utilizes the following API's to fetch and display data:
- [Instagram API](http://instagram.com/developer/)

Popstagram implements the following libraries and frameworks:

- [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking) - A delightful iOS and OS X networking framework

- [Mantle](https://github.com/Mantle/Mantle) - A model framework for Cocoa and Cocoa Touch

- [MBProgressHUD](https://github.com/jdg/MBProgressHUD) - MBProgressHUD + Customizations

Display the most popular photos on Instagram at the moment.
